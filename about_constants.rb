  # QUESTION: Now which has precedence: The constant in the lexical
  # scope, or the constant from the inheritance hierarchy?  Why is it
  # different than the previous answer?
  #
  # In this case, the constant in the inheritance hierarchy has precedence
  # over the lexical scope because we first assign the 2 with the explicit
  # MyAnimals::Oyster scoping and then assign the 4 with < Animal.
  #
  # In the first case, when we assigned the Bird < Animal we are creating
  # the inner class from inheritance first and the LEGS = 2 assignment
  # is coming "after"
